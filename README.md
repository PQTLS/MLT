# pq-tls-test

PQ-TLS-Test is a project dedicated to testing post-quantum secure TLS handshakes. The project aims to provide comprehensive insights into the performance of post-quantum cryptography (PQC) by evaluating various handshake modes, client loads, and network topologies.

## Key Features
### Handshake Modes 
Supports testing of 1-RTT, PSK, and 0-RTT handshake modes.
### Client Load
Evaluates server performance under varying numbers of client connections.
### Network Topologies
Creates multiple network namespaces to simulate different network configurations and topologies, i.e., ring, star and tree.
